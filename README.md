# comptools24

Materials for [Computational Tools for PDEs with Complicated Geometries and Interfaces](https://indico.flatironinstitute.org/event/3917) workshop, June 10-14, 2024, Flatiron Institute.

This is common place to host lecture notes and discuss notations.

Please create a separate folder for each lecture or session.

Please post an [Issue](https://github.com/ahbarnett/comptools24/issues>) to start a discussion, add a to-do item, or propose changes to material written by others.


### Beamer template

There is a local copy of our CCM Beamer templates for slides in the top
level directory.

* the example file is `CCM_example.tex`
* use `pdflatex` not classic `latex`
* user may adjust `\bottombarheight` in the `.sty` file, to taste


### Notations

Please see `notations.tex` which is a set of beamer slides with proposed potential theory and PDE notations to help make the lectures throughout the week coherent, and minimize cognitive load on attendees learning the material. This will also minimize notation conflicts (overloading).

Please try to use the notations, unless there is a good reason you cannot stick to them (in which case mention the change in your talk).
