# comptools24

Materials for Computational Tools for PDEs with Complicated Geometries and Interfaces workshop, June 10-14, 2024, Flatiron Institute.
[Indico site](https://indico.flatironinstitute.org/event/3917)
[CVent site (registration and local info)](https://events.simonsfoundation.org/event/e464a4a7-608a-4aa7-9bb7-45c3da427adb/summary)

This is common place to host lecture note sources and some intro demo codes
(not the main software library repos).

Please create a separate folder for each day.

Please post an [Issue](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/comptools24/issues) to start a discussion, add a to-do item, or propose changes to material written by others.


### Beamer template

There is a local copy of our CCM Beamer templates for slides in the
`templates` directory.

* the example file is `CCM_example.tex`
* use `pdflatex` not classic `latex`
* user may adjust `\bottombarheight` in the `.sty` file, to taste


### Notations

Please see `notations.tex` which is a set of beamer slides with proposed potential theory and PDE notations to help make the lectures throughout the week coherent, and minimize cognitive load on attendees learning the material. This will also minimize notation conflicts (overloading).

Please try to use the notations, unless there is a good reason you cannot stick to them (in which case mention the change in your talk).
